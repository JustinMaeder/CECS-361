Complete Pong Game
•	Designed a single player pong game utilizing a VGA synchronization module for a 640-by-480-pixel screen.

•	Displayed one static object: a wall and two animated objects: a paddle and a ball.

•	Verified the design with a self-checking test bench to ensure the 12 requirements in the VGA sync were met.
